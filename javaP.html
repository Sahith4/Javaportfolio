    <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CVS HealthCare (Nov 2022 - Present)</strong> - <b>Project Explanation:</b> Building RESTful APIs for a Pharmacy System
        <br><b>Business Logic:</b> "At CVS Healthcare, the goal was to make prescription refills faster and easier for customers. The business wanted a system where patients could order refills online or through an app, and pharmacies could process them without delaysâ€”basically, keeping customers happy and reducing staff workload."<br>
        <b>What I Did:</b> "I led the charge on creating RESTful APIs using Spring Boot. I designed them with OpenAPI standards so theyâ€™d be easy to maintain and scale. I used Spring Data to connect to the Oracle database and pull patient info quickly, and I built a slick React JS front-end so users could interact with it seamlessly. I also added Spring Security with LDAP to make sure only authorized people could access sensitive data."
        <br><b>Skills Implemented:</b> "This was all about Java 8, Spring Boot, React, and SQL. I used multi-threading to handle tons of requests at once and Kafka to push updatesâ€”like refill statusesâ€”to other systems in real time."
        </li>
      <li><strong>Morgan Stanley (Oct 2020 - Nov 2022)</strong> <b>Project Explanation:</b> Microservices for Wealth Management Dashboard
        <br><b>Business Logic:</b> "At Morgan Stanley, the business needed a dashboard for clients to track their investments in real time. They wanted it fast, secure, and easy to update as markets changedâ€”basically, helping clients feel in control of their money."
        <br><b>What I Did:</b> "I designed a microservices setup with Spring Boot and REST APIs to pull financial data. I used Angular on the front-end to make it dynamic and user-friendly, and Hibernate to map data from the Oracle database. I also set up Jenkins and Docker for smooth deployments to AWS, keeping everything running without hiccups."
        <br><b>Skills Implemented:</b> "I leaned on Java, Spring MVC, Angular, and AWS tools like ECS and S3. I wrote JUnit tests to catch bugs early and used Terraform to manage the cloud setup."
        </li>
      <li><strong>Toyota Financial Services (Nov 2019 - Sep 2020)</strong> <b>Project Explanation:</b> Loan Processing Microservices
        <br><b>Business Logic:</b> "Toyota Financial Services wanted to speed up car loan approvals. The business logic was simple: faster approvals mean more sales, and they needed a system that could handle tons of applications without crashing."
        <br><b>What I Did:</b>"I built RESTful microservices with Spring Boot to process loan applications. I used Java 17â€™s concurrency features to handle multiple requests at once, and Docker to package everything up. I deployed it to AWS ECS using Jenkins, and added Redis caching to make data retrieval lightning-fast."
        <br><b>Skills Implemented:</b> "This was heavy on Java 17, Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes. I also used Swagger to document the APIs so the team could collaborate easily."
        </li>
      <li><strong>Ivy Comptech (Jan 2016 - Nov 2017)</strong> <b>Project Explanation:</b> Gaming Platform APIs
        <br><b>Business Logic:</b> "At Ivy Comptech, we worked on a gaming platform where the business wanted players to have a smooth, real-time experienceâ€”think instant leaderboard updates and no lag during bets."
        <br><b>What I Did:</b> "I developed microservices with Spring Boot and Node.js to handle game data. I used Kafka to push real-time updates and React JS for a snappy front-end. I also worked with MongoDB to store player stats and wrote Java 8 lambda expressions to process data faster."
        <br><b>Skills Implemented:</b> "Java 8, Spring Boot, React, and Kafka were my go-tos. I also used Jenkins and AWS EC2 to keep deployments smooth."
        </li>
      <li><strong>HSBC (June 2013 - Dec 2015)</strong> <b>Project Explanation:</b> Online Banking Enhancements
        <br><b>Business Logic:</b> "At HSBC, the business wanted customers to manage their accounts online easilyâ€”like transferring money or checking balancesâ€”without calling support. It was all about convenience and cutting costs."
        <br><b>What I Did:</b> "I built a Spring Boot web app with REST APIs to handle transactions. I used Hibernate to connect to Oracle, and added a JSP and JavaScript front-end for a clean user experience. I also implemented Spring Security to keep everything safe."
        <br><b>Skills Implemented:</b>  "This was Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and some front-end work with JavaScript. I wrote complex SQL queries to pull account data fast."
